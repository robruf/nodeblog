## NodeBlog - Create your blog and share your posts with the community (or not!)

Nodeblog allows you to create your own blog and post content on it. You can decide whether or not your posts should be public or not. If public, all other NodeBlog users will be able to see your post in the index page, where all public posts from all users are displayed.

You can edit or delete your posts, comment all posts (if public) and edit or delete your comments. You can also delete other user's comments on your posts. 

A public post can be changed to a private one and viceversa.

You can visualize other's blogs by clicking on their username. You will be brought on the user's blog page and you will be able to see all of his public posts.

You are required to sign up and login in order to use the platform. Username and password are the only two required things in order to sign up. This will be probably changed in future releases.

Front-end side of the app is quite basic. Huge front-end styling to be done in the next release.

Lot of things to be added. This is a first beta release and there's lot of room for customization. 

Feel free to share your ideas on how to make this a better platform.

Technologies/Frameworks involved: 
    > Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap4, JQuery
    > Back-end: Node.JS (Express, Passport, EJS and other libraries), MongoDB
